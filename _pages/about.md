Welcome to My Corner of the Web!
Hi there! I’m Ali Morajabi, a 21-year-old Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Tehran. I’m passionate about technology, especially Artificial Intelligence, which I’ve been diving into recently. Whether you’re here to explore my projects, share ideas, or simply say hello, I’m excited to have you! Feel free to browse around and connect with me—I’d love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for stopping by!
